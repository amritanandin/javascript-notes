// Introduction :
// JavaScript is a programming language used primarily for creating interactive and dynamic web content.
// It was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich, while he was working at Netscape Communications Corporation.
// JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted language, which means that it is designed to be easy to
// read and write, and it doesn't need to be compiled before it can be run.

// JavaScript is also used for server-side programming, most commonly through the Node.js 
// runtime environment. With Node.js, JavaScript can be used to create web servers, command-line tools,
// and other back-end applications.

// After HTML and CSS, JavaScript is the third biggest web technology.
